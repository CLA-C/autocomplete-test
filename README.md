# autocomplete-test
Simple app to test an autocomplete input written in AngularJS.

## Setup
To get up and running as soon as possible I used the angular starter app at [https://github.com/preboot/angularjs-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angularjs-webpack), with some minor tweaks. It uses **Webpack 2.x** for all bundling and building purposes.
